TODO for api...

1. fix the problems with delete and get by id not working
2. add validation -- JSON Schema
	a. for RBs
	b. for WRs
	c. for TEs
3. add JSDoc for all my functions
4. possibly convert to TypeScript?




TODO for database...

1. add in indexes?  On what though and for what reason?




TODO for UI/Front end

1. everything
 a. first -- just set up an HTML page that will display the results of one button press that calls my api for RBs

In order to do anything, I'm going to have to watch all the angular videos over the next couple of days.  So just get that done...easy enough



TODO etc. 

1. review concepts in Anki...I've let this sit for a long time so it'll take a couple hours or more.  Tommorrow morning maybe.
